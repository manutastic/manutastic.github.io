    <h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
    <p>Most of all, I like creating. Programming lets me make things that other people might find useful 
        or entertaining, just by typing on a keyboard. My free time is spent <a href="/projects">working on 
        projects</a>, teaching myself new concepts and technologies, cooking, reading, and exercising.
        If you have any questions, don't hesitate to <a href="#contact">contact me.</a> </p>

    <h3> About this website </h3>
