description: "A working calculator."
preview: "A quick exercise to practice both my Javascript and CSS skills. I designed and coded a simple calculator on CodePen, which can perform basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A lot of work was put into making the calculator behave how the user would expect."
