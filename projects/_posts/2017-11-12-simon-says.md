title: "Simon Says"
description: "A full game with graphics and sound."
preview: "In an attempt to teach myself Python and Pygame, I decided to build the classic game of Simon Says. Pygame doesn't have a built in rounded-rectangles method, so the hardest challenge in this project was actually getting the four buttons to display properly, with subtle outlines and all."
