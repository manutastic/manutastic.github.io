title: "Tic-Tac-Toe"
description: "Working game with computer opponent."
preview: "The classic game of tic-tac-toe, written in Javascript. The biggest challenge was figuring out the right algorithm for the computer opponent. The trick was actually making sure it wasn't so good that you could never win. In the end I found that having the computer make a mistake 3/7 times was a good balance."
