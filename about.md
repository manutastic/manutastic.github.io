# A bit about me
Most of all, I like creating. I love programming because just by typing away on a keyboard I can make things that other people might find useful or entertaining. My free time is spent [working on projects](/projects), and teaching myself new concepts and technologies.

I also enjoy

In addition to my passion for software development, I come from a strong design background. I attended an art school in the Design District of Miami, where I have been lucky enough to make connections with diverse people and work as a graphic and web designer. This means Iâ€™m not just another coder, I have a knack for making things that are both enjoyable to interact with and beautiful to look at.
